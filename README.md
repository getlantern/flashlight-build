flashlight-build [![Travis CI Status](https://travis-ci.org/getlantern/flashlight-build.svg?branch=devel)](https://travis-ci.org/getlantern/flashlight-build)&nbsp;[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/getlantern/flashlight-build/badge.png?branch=devel)](https://coveralls.io/r/getlantern/flashlight-build)
==========

flashlight-build is a [gost](https://github.com/getlantern/gost) project that
provides repeatable builds and consolidated pull requests for flashlight (now
lantern).

Flashlight requires [Go 1.4.x](http://golang.org/dl/).

It is convenient to build flashlight for multiple platforms using
[gox](https://github.com/mitchellh/gox).

The typical cross-compilation setup doesn't work for anything that uses C code,
which includes the DNS resolution code and some other things.  See
[this blog](https://inconshreveable.com/04-30-2014/cross-compiling-golang-programs-with-native-libraries/)
for more discussion.

To deal with that, you need to use a Go installed using
[gonative](https://github.com/getlantern/gonative). Ultimately, you can put this
go wherever you like. Ox keeps his at ~/go_native.

```bash
go get github.com/mitchellh/gox
go get github.com/inconshreveable/gonative
cd ~
gonative build -version="1.4.1" -platforms="darwin_amd64 linux_386 linux_amd64 windows_386"
mv go go_native
```

Finally update your GOROOT and PATH to point at `~/go_native` instead of your
previous go installation.  They should look something like this:

```bash
➜  flashlight git:(1606) ✗ echo $GOROOT
/Users/ox.to.a.cart//go_native
➜  flashlight git:(1606) ✗ which go
/Users/ox.to.a.cart//go_native/bin/go
```

Now that you have go and gox set up, the binaries used for Lantern can be built
with the `./crosscompile.bash` script. This script also sets the version of
flashlight to the most recent commit id in git, or if the most recent commit is
tagged, the tag of that commit id.

An annotated tag can be added like this:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m"Tagged 1.0.0"
git push --tags
```

The script `tagandbuild.bash` tags and runs crosscompile.bash.

`./tagandbuild.bash <tag>`

Note - ./crosscompile.bash omits debug symbols to keep the build smaller.

### Packaging for OS X
Lantern on OS X is packaged as the `Lantern.app` app bundle, distributed inside
of a drag-and-drop dmg installer. The app bundle and dmg can be created using
`./package_osx.bash`.

This script requires the node module `appdmg`. Assuming you have homebrew
installed, you can get it with ...

```bash
brew install node
npm install -g appdmg
```

`./package_osx.bash` signs the Lantern.app using the BNS code signing
certificate in your KeyChain. The [certificate](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/osx-code-signing-certificate.p12)
and [password](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/osx-code-signing-certificate.p12.txt)
can be obtained from [too-many-secrets](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets).

If signing fails, the script will still build the app bundle and dmg, but the
app bundle won't be signed. Unsigned app bundles can be used for testing but
should never be distributed to end users.

The background image for the DMG is `dmgbackground.png` and the icon is in
`lantern.icns`.

### Packaging on Windows
Lantern on Windows is currently distributed as an executable (no installer).
This executable should be signed with `./package_windows.bash` prior to
distributing it to end users.

Signing windows code requires that the
[osslsigncode](http://sourceforge.net/projects/osslsigncode/) utility be
installed. On OS X with homebrew, you can do this with
`brew install osslsigncode`.

For `./package_windows.bash` to be able to sign the executable, the environment
varaibles BNS_CERT and BNS_CERT_PASS must be set to point to
[bns-cert.p12](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/bns_cert.p12)
and its [password](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/build-installers/env-vars.txt#L3).
You can set the environment variables and run the script on one line, like this:

`BNS_CERT=<cert> BNS_CERT_PASS=<pass> ./package_windows.bash`

### Updating Icons

The icons used for the system tray are stored in
src/github/getlantern/flashlight/icons. To apply changes to the icons, make your
updates in the icons folder and then run `./udpateicons.bash`.

### Continuous Integration with Travis CI
Continuous builds are run on Travis CI. These builds use the `.travis.yml`
configuration.  The github.com/getlantern/cf unit tests require an envvars.bash
to be populated with credentials for cloudflare. The original `envvars.bash` is
available [here](https://github.com/getlantern/too-many-secrets/blob/master/envvars.bash).
An encrypted version is checked in as `envvars.bash.enc`, which was encrypted
per the instructions [here](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encrypting-files/).
